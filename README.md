# NEAT

## A Rust implementation of evolving neural networks through augmenting topologies  

NEAT is a type of genetic algorithm which evolves neural networks by modifying both the structure
and the weight parameters.

#### TODO

- Add speciation
- fitness function
- flatten network
- unflatten network
- species breeding
